    <title>I Love Cake</title>

<h1>I love cake. I'm not afraid to shout it to the mountain top.</h1>
<p>That's right. I love all kind of cake. Chocolate, vanilla, cherry and fruit based. If there is extra frosting or marsipan, all the better. I would happily run a 5K if there was cake at the finish line. </p>
